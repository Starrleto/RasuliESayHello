Say Hello
Make an API that outputs a personalized greeting with a string parameter

Peer Review, Sebastian, 11:40: The project is fully complete, doing what is expected in little code: it takes a name and outputs "Hello, {name}". I had trouble using strings when doing my own project, but this assignment showed me how - thumbs up.
